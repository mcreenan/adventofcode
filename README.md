# Solutions for the adventofcode.com challenge

Each day is it's own directory which contains:

1. An input file (called `input`) -- which is my input
2. An output file (called `output`) -- which is the output expected from my input
3. 1 or more solution files (e.g. `solution.p6`, `solution.py`). All solution scripts take a single argument which is the path to the input file. None of the scripts have error checking if you don't pass any arguments.

## Languages used

1. **Python 2** -- I usually write these scripts first.  I write them quickly to get the answers as soon as possible, not for readability. So the quality of the code in these is generally lower, unless I decide to go back and clean it up a bit.
2. **Perl6** -- I write these as a learning excercise, so I try to use as many new language features as I can. Sometimes the use of certain features may not be the best solution, but I use them just to learn.
