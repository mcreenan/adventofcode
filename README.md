Solutions for the adventofcode.com challenge

Each day is it's own directory which contains:

1. An input file (called `input`) -- which is my input
2. An output file (called `output`) -- which is the output expected from my input
3. 1 or more solution files (e.g. `solution.p6`, `solution.py`)

All solution scripts take a single argument which is the path to the input file. None of the scripts have error checking if you don't pass any arguments.
